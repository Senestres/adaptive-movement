In our theory articles, we focus on the ecological-dynamics framework, as well as non-linear pedagogy and the constraints-led approach. We want to make these theories, methods and concepts more accessible. These theories challenge some traditional          assumptions about skill acquisition and motor learning. They also might help you understand better why you do what you do.
    Our how-to articles offer a more practical approach, and are meant to develop sound, evidence-based coaching principles, while also aiming to spark creative and novel solutions.
    Finally, we also examine case studies from different sport, physical activities or coaching methods, from the perspective of ecological-dynamics. What can we learn from these cases? Could they be improved?
